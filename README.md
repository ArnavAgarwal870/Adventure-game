But it  is not all a safe passage! If youo run into your teacher twice you get caught for bunking
and lose if the Rep sees you and you run into her:
a)by trying to go in a direction there isn't a room? GAME OVER
b)by backtracking into a room you were already in the move before? GAME OVER
but don't worry the rep will not chase you forever and will stop after a few turns
You can also go to the floor above or below using the staircases
